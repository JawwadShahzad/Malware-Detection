# Malware-Detection-with-Machine-Learning
#Introduction
The project endeavors to construct a robust Machine Learning Model for discerning malware, enabling swift identification to thwart potential zero-day threats. By leveraging data analytics, it aims to enhance security measures, detecting novel malware strains and fortifying defenses against emerging cyber threats. 
# Existing System
In all current systems of malware detection they rely on system monitoring tools such as sysmon or toolsets such as sysinternals. Furthermore, Many companies used online Sandboxes to test whether or not a file is of malware or benign nature.
# Problem Statement
In the current systems of malware detection, we aim to train a model which will determine, with accuracy, if a file is of benign or malicious nature.
# Proposed Solution
In our solution, we aim to find and train the best ML learning model for detecting Malware. We will generate multiple reports using cuckoo sandbox. There reports will then be used to 
# Salient Features 
1.	Generate multiple reports using cuckoo sandbox, which will then compile it into a CSV file.
2.	The project will test the data with the models:
a.	Random Forest
b.	Decisions Tree
c.	KNN 
d.	SVC
e.	Logistic Regression
3.	The project will aim to identify malwares for the linux Operating Systems(.elf) and Windows Operating(.exe) 
Tools & Technologies
1.	The project will use python as the core programming language. 
2.	the Project will use Kali Linux as the core testing operating system
3.	the Project will use the cuckoo sandbox to generate reports in json format
4.	the Project will use the multiple python libraries:
a.	 os
b.	 json
c.	 numpy 
d.	 pandas 
e.	 matplotlib
f.	 warnings
g.	scikit-learn
